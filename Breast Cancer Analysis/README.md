# breast_cancer_decision_tree
ADTA 5120 breast cancer decision tree case study. The Wisconsin Breast Cancer data consists of attribute information on fineneedle aspirated breast tissue from 569 women. Information on each sample includes

Column A: Patient ID number

Column B: Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

Columns C â€“ AF: Summary statistics on ten real-valued features computed from each cell nucleus in a sample
  
      a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)

      b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)

      c) perimeter

      d) area

      e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)

      f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)

      g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)

      h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)

      i) symmetry

      j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation")

For each feature, the mean, standard deviation, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) were computed for each sample, resulting in 30 measurements. For example, column C is Mean Radius (of cells measured in biopsy), column M is Radius SD (of cells measured in biopsy), column W is Worst Radius (worst cell radius measured in biopsy).
