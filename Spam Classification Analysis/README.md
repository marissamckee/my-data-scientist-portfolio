# Spam-Classification

### Objective: You have been hired as a consultant and your objective is to fit a model that best predicts a spam e-mail.

## Data: 
The data for this assignment is the ‘Spambase’ data set. The data must be downloaded from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The data will need to be read into R using the function read.csv().

A description of the data and the statistical problem can be found on the author’s website.

## Objective: 
Concern about unsolicited bulk email, commonly referred to as spam, has been steadily increasing. When received in small quantities, spam may annoy recipients, but rarely poses a significant problem. However, some recipients of large quantities of spam find themselves so overwhelmed with unwanted email that it is time-consuming or difficult for them to hunt for their desired correspondence. 

There is growing concern that the volume of spam sent each day may increase substantially and that bulk mailers may adopt increasingly sophisticated techniques to thwart automated filtering tools. I have been hired as a consultant to fit a model that best predicts a spam e-mail. To do that I’ve fit four models using R: 
- linear discriminant analysis
- decision tree
- support vector machine
- random forest
