This is a simulation model of retirement success. The objective is to withdraw enough money over a 30 year period to 
sustain your lifestyle before going broke. 1 = success 0 = broke. 
The program is simulated 1000 and 100 times iterating with the variables below: 

Starting retirement funds = $1,000,000

Withdraw = $40,000,  $60,000, $80,000, $100,000

Retirement years = 30
